  
The room was spacious, clean, sound proof and with high ceiling.  The bed was super comfortable. It is very close to the train station.  As the hostel is located in the main street so it’s very easy to get a taxi to go find food. The hostel gave us coupons to get breakfast in the nearby cafe. 
The host, Carlos, is super hospitable. It makes a big difference to our trip. He will go out of his way to attend to his customers’ requests and make your stay enjoyable.   His knows all the good places to eat in Hualien.  I gave five stars to all the restaurants recommendations.  The host is multi-lingual.  He  speaks cantonese, mandarin and english.  I gave his personalised service 10 stars.
