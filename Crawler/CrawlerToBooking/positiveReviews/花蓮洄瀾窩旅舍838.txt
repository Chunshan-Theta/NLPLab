甚麼都喜歡! 非常舒適! 房間裡的設施很棒! 比網站上所看到的都還要棒! 
Room: i live in a 4 bed girls dorm. Each bed has its very own curtain so that we could have our own private space. Besides, everyone has one locker which can only be open with the room card. The pillows and blanket are very comfortable too. However, the cons are we couldn't switch off the main light and we cant feel the air conditioner at all. I didn't file any complain as it doesn't really affects me.
房間: 我住在女生宿舍4人房. 床位有窗簾可以遮擋所以非常有私人空間. 而且,床位裡頭的櫃子使用電子卡來解鎖, 感覺放東西很安全. 此外, 被單和枕頭也很舒適! 只是, 如果房間的大燈可以關會更好, 而且去的時候沒有冷氣. 可是我本身不太介意,所以沒有和櫃檯反映. 
Toilet: I will give them a 5 star for their cleanliness and design. 
廁所: 乾淨度與設計非常好! 
Staff: Very very friendly. I didn't plan my trip at all. Decided everything with the help of the staff there and i will definitely be going back to the same hostel again! 
工作人員: 態度很好! 幫我很多很多的忙!
Others: Common space are really cool. and they have everything a bag packer need. You can even go there with just money and maybe another pair of clothes. You can even cook there and make your breakfast there.
其他: 公共場所很棒! 有所有背包旅客要的東西! 可以做早餐!
