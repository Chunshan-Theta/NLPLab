  
1. 非常有規劃的一間hostel. 各種物品擺放位置有規劃，乾淨，已像YHA。
2. 在黃金地段卻空間寬敞沒有壓迫感，竟只要600+。 地點絕佳，對面就是巴士轉運站。
3. 處處可見規劃上的貼心用心 
(a)個人置物鎖櫃就是床頭櫃，不用再進進出出。(b)提供耳塞、拖鞋。(c)房內的吊衣桿夠長。(d)安全，到房間經過3次感應鎖。(e)浴廁非常乾淨，且設有擋水浴簾，可放心沖澡，好舒服！(f)還有咖啡機！
總之，非常舒服的環境！
1. Clean. Tidy. A very organized place. 
2. Great location and wide space with only 600+ per bed/night. 
3. Very thoughtful for travellers, ex:
(a)Personal Locker is your "beside cabinet", don't need to go in and out. Get your stuff at arm's reach (b)Provide ear plug and flip flops (c) Long-enough clotheshorse(built on wall) in room. (d)Safe; stayed at 4-bed female dorm, I needed to pass 3 sensor-locks to get to my room. (e)Really clean bath/shower room; with a plastic curtain for you to enjoy care-free splash. (f) (Grinding) Coffee machine available! (g) Quiet. 
All in all, a really cozy and convenient stay here.
