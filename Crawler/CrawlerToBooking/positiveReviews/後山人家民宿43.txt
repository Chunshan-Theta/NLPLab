從一開始就感受得出來民宿主人很用心在經營這間民宿。如果有去台東一定會再入住。這種感恩的感受真的讓人無法忘記！謝謝老闆和老闆娘！
I think this hotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. The whole experience was phenomenal. It was very personal and the owners were very welcoming. First, it is a quiet place and the interior design is beautiful. The moment you stepped into the place you felt tranquility. Wood was a main theme of the house and it is lovely. Oh, the rooms are very nice, love the bathroom and the beds are so comfortable. I had a great few night sleeps there. Second, the owners are very welcoming and accommodating. They saw that we have four adults and upgraded us to a bigger family room. It was very sweet of them. The owners also went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They shared their life stories and made us felt as if we were visiting a friend! Also, the owner took us to his friend's beautiful garden where they follows Nature Farming (established in 1936 by Mokichi Okada, the founder of the Church of World Messianity, an agricultural system originally called "no fertilizer farming" or 自然農法) It was an eye-opening experience that transformed my view on agriculture. I certainly gained more knowledge on what food is supposed to taste&look like. Third, the breakfast was delicious. It was a traditional Taiwanese breakfast but all the vegetables were grown by the owners and other ingredients were from local organic farms. I cannot stress how tasty the breakfast was!
Overall it was an experience of a lifetime. The owners made it memorable. They were very helpful throughout the stay, I will definitely go back in the future. I LOVE this place!
