  
excellent location with parks, tennis courts, convenient stores and restaurants around.  also a McDonard is only a few steps away.  the hotel offers free pick up service from and to the Hsr and train station. free bicycle to borrow.  staffs are friendly and helpful.  breakfast is a bit simple but ok.  very high c/p value. good for family leisure or business stays.  recommended.  
位置很好,人員親切又熱心. 有高鐵台鐵預約接送. 腳踏車免費使用. cp值高. 推薦
