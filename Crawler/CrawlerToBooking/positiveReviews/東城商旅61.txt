Great Location. Both walking distance  to the Dongtamen city night market and the Culture & Creativity Park. The hotel also offers free bikes rental and we had a great afternoon riding the bike along the coast, which is about 10 minutes on the bike from the hotel. Staff were very friendly. The breakfast buffet was delicious too.
