The 5 stars meal. The owner is super nice and friendly. It’s very quiet and relax. The place seems a bit far from the center of the city, but it’s not that hard to get there. It only took about 20 minuets by scooter from Yilan train station. Such a nice place for people who wants get away from the crowd and busyness of city life.
