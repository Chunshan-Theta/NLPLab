It's overall an excellent place to stay. The owners are hospitable and generous.  When we checked in, the hostess gave us enough travel information about Taitung. They would prepare lots of food like biscuits, instant noodles, drinks, friut, or fresh milk for the guests to enjoy. You can find food for you on the dining table, on the shelves, and in the fridge. The living room is very comfortable and well-designed. You can find some board games there. The room is nicely decorated and very clean. People whom we met here were very nice guests. The breakfast was very tasty. We loved the peanuts, fresh fruit, and milk. Thanks. :)
