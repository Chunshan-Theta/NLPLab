  
lovely designed hotel located in ximen. I travelled with my parents with 3 beds (japanese style). Rooms are clean and nicely decorated. love the breakfast vouchers included in the booking that can be used in nearby breakfast restaurant. Great variety and reasonable price for the breakfast. wifi speed is fine too. generally a nice stay, thank you!
