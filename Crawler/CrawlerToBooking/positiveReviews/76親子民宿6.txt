Very huge room compare to the resort/hotels that I had ever stayed. The environment is above average clean, especially the bathtub is very clean. The farm scenery is very relaxing, which is great! The milk tea and lemon tea is very delicious. The host was very polite, but difficult to find the host during the night time. When check out, we forgot the things stored inside refrigerator, and they called right away, which was sweet!
