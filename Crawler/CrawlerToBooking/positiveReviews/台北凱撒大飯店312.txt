  
The staff at the front desk and the doormen were very helpful. I was promised a crib for my baby when I reserved the room on booking.com but somehow the crib was not prepared. The front desk made a quick phone call and the crib was ready within minutes after I got to my room. The doormen were nice enough to help us carry our stroller up a small staircase at the front door. (Only about 5 steps up but it's still hard on me as the stroller and baby add up to about 45lbs) I would really appreciate it if they can add a small ramp so that their front door is wheelchair and stroller accessible. The upside is that the hotel is right across Taipei railway station.
