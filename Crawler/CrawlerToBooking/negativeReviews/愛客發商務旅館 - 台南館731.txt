  
We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. Maybe because this hotel is really old, we found the toilet bowl a bit blocking. The other morning after the first night stay, we told the staff they might need to take a look at it. When we were back to the hotel at the same evening time, found a note put on the toilet bowl saying "請勿丟垃圾入馬桶, Please Don't garbage in the toilet". Straight away we thought this is the hotel's finger pointing at us that it's ourselves to throw garbage in and led to the blocking! I expressed the grievances and soon, a staff knocked on our door and tried to explain, but he finally said because the responsible staff was off and need him to explain why he wrote that note. We became softened actually, but another staff rang us at 11pm while all of us fell asleep and said he wanted to explain. Of course the fury came again. We don't understand how difficult to say sorry to a customer who actually suffered from the blocking toilet and also their disturbances.
我們在這家酒店住了2晚。也許因為這家酒店真的老了，我們發現馬桶有點堵塞。度過了一個晚上的第二天早上，我們告訴工作人員他們可能需要看一下。當我們在同一天晚上回酒店的時候，發現便條放在馬桶上寫著“請勿丟垃圾入馬桶,Please don't garbage in the toilet"。直接我們想到這是酒店的手指指控我們，這是我們自己扔的垃圾，並導致堵塞！我們打電話到服務櫃台表示不滿，不久之後，一名工作人員敲門，試圖解釋，但他最後說，因為負責人員已經下班，需要他再解釋他為什麼寫這個便條。實際上我們聽了是有軟化了，可是在晚上十一點鐘, 當我們所有人都睡著的時候, 有個職員又打電話來 說他要解釋。當然，我們的憤怒又來了。我們不明白對於一個真正遭受堵塞廁所之苦和不停受到騷擾的客戶而言, 道個歉有那麼困難嗎?
