  
The twin room is quite small and the lightning is too dark for reading. The pillow is too soft & the quilt is too thin for the cold weather that extra blanket & heater is required.  It is stupid to place a high square bathtub inside a small toilet that caused much inconvenience & danger.  By the way, there is not much change in everyday breakfast & not hot enough.
