The room size is much smaller than expected, decor of the hotel room is a bit like budge business hotel. There is no hot air mode with the aircon, and no breakfast provided. The location of the hotel is near metro stations. There are a few restaurants near by and one 7/11 store. But it's a bit of a travel to anywhere that worths visiting in Taipei. Comparing to other hotels stayed in Taipei, the value for money is not great. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
