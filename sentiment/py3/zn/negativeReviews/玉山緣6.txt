1. Full of ants in the room 2.unbelievable small area, too tiny too expensive 3.the breakfast tastes and looks unfresh, I think it was kept in refrigerator for long long time 4.repairing New rooms and making noise to 10pm. We just want to listen to the wood/countryside music, but it was full of noise. How terrible experience it was. 5. Electric Lights are surrounding the garden, so it is impossible to have a look of stars.  But there were a lot of stars should be looked that night.
This staying experience made us very disappointed and unhappy.
