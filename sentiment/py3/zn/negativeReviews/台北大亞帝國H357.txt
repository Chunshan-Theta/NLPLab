Even with no-smoking policies enforced, there was smell of cigarettes in our first room. It felt like someone was smoking right in the room. It obviously traveled through the ventilation system. We complained with the front desk 3 times and they finally agreed to get us to another room. Out of the 4 people we communicated the problem with, 2 were particularly friendly and helpful.
