I have been more than 20 countries and stay more than a hundred accommodations. Although the hotel is new but the air is not fresh and smell weird in the room. The room service is bad, reception service is so so. There are many hotels here and  I would suggest that you stay at another hotel. Btw, the single bed size is pretty small.
