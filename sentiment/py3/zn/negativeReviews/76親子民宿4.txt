Some of the wall needed to be repaint. Seems like rooms with slides inside will be better as kids can play inside the room all the time. There are some toys downstairs at the lobby but a bit too old without update. Probably because of the rain, most of the electric-cars are not possible for my kid to play. The desert in the afternoon and breakfast looks pretty, but taste normal. A little bit too oily and plain taste. Probably took too much time in the plating and the food got cold already.
