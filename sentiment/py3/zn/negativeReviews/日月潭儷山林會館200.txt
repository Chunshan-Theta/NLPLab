  
the regular daily cleanup is not timely done but with the reminder, the staff came to do the cleanup right after the nap; there was a construction project ongoing just outside of our window but we were not informed once we checked in, and my two-year old boy was scared by the loud noise. However, the front desk did offer a better room type, even though we didn't take the offer but it was a good gesture, and at the departure I received a gift pack with the local black tea and a cup which is a nice part of memory. Some other minor areas to be improved are that the toys at the playground need to change the battery, and the staff at the restaurant may need to be trained to be more professional.
