I stayed here for two nights. The second night, don't know what's wrong with the staff or management system, the staff gave another traveler the key, and let him enter my room at mid-night when I was sleeping because the room was showed as empty in the computer! This broke all the check-in experience. If the accident is not happened, I think it worth 8 points.
