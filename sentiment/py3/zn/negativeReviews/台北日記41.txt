  
Booking.com網頁上說有迎賓飲品，但Check in時，沒有收到
房間的水不夠喝
早餐是吃肯德基，距離還旅館算近，東西也OK，但份量太少
訂雙人房，但床是2張單人床合起來的
The web showed that a drinking for guests is available while I check in but it didnt
The water in the room is enough
Breakfast was KFC ,it was delicious as well as near to facility but not enough for a man (I'm still hungry) 
I reserved a double room, but the bed is combined from 2 single beds,it was uncomfortable.
