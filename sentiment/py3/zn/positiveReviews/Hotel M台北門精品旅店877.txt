  
1. 服務人員反應的速度很快
The staff members were attentive throughout check-in and when we called with issues (which will be described in the 'cons' part)
2. 因為我們三人要住三晚就訂了比較大間的房, 因此房間的空間以台北的標準來說很寬敞. The executive room we booked was very spacious for Taipei standard. 
3. 離臺北火車站步行10分鐘內可到達. Location close to Taipei main station.
