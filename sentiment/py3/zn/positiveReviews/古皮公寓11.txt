It’s more convenient to rent a scooter or a car to go wherever you want because the site is a little bit far from the beach or main street. And, do not forget to bring your own toothbrush, they are not provide it for environmental protection! RECOMMEND!
房間很美，且超級舒適呀，一覺到天亮！房價也比墾丁其他旅館便宜太多了（如果沒有執著於房間要看見海的話）
早餐可去附近的橘子早餐，我每去墾丁必吃🤤
記得要帶自己的牙刷，旅館不提供喔！一起環保愛地球！
