The guesthouse is safe and well located, with easy access to bus stops, beaches, and the main street/night market. The room is well equipped (hot & powerful shower, hair drier, and free bottled water are provided). The owners and staff are all very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended (esp. for single female backpackers).
