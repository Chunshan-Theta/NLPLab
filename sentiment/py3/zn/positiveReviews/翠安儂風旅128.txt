  
The staff were very friendly and quickly responded to our wish of changing the room and fixed the problem that the shower door could not be closed.
Free bicycle and child seat were provided, which is very convenient for a day of city tour. Hot water and wash machine are provided. The nearby Montes Foreign restaurant recommended by the staff for dinner is a little pricy but the portion is big and the food is excellent, worthy to try.
