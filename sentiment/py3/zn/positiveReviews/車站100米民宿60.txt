  
great location (5 mins walk from train station), very friendly owner, the room is clean and very comfortable bed. they make breakfast when you are ready to eat, fresh vegetables, fruits, handmade bread. Will stay there again next time visiting Hualien. 
老闆很親切，凡事親力親為。離火車站只有幾分鐘走路時間，房間舒適乾淨，床很舒服。早餐是在你下樓到餐廳時馬上現作(約等五分鐘)，也可以送到房間用餐。剛到的第一天，就決定下次拜訪花蓮時會再住這間。
