  
住宿的環境非常舒適! 我和朋友特別喜歡每個床位都有掛牆的電視，而且也有獨立的櫃子可以上鎖放私人物品。他們家還會每天提供清潔的洗漱用品，共用的浴室和洗手間也很乾淨，女生的浴室裡還會提供卸妝油，非常方便貼心:) 
This hostel is super cozy. My friend and I were amazed by the TV provided in each bunk bed, you can enjoy your TV time just before you fall asleep without disturbing your roommate as it has provided you a headphone, which was kinda sweet! Clean towel and brushes were served everyday, not to mention the shared bathroom was absolutely neat, the cleansing oil for removing makeup were free to use.  
PS. We met friends from German and we stayed late chatting in the common area, especially appreciate Brad for your kindness during our whole stay in Justwalk Hostel! Thank you very much!
