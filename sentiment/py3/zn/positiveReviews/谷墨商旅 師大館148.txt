  
People here are very nice, there were some little dessert when we checked in at 3pm. Room is big enough for our shiba to run and not so nervous. There’s near by Night market, a lot of delicious food could buy easily. If you want to take a walk, you can go to Da An Frost park(I am not sure if the spell is right haha). 
員工都很親切，三點左右入住還有下午茶可以享用。房間裡空間足夠，我們的柴犬很喜歡。鄰近師大夜市，美食非常多可以好好享用。飯後散步的話可以到大安森林公園走走。
