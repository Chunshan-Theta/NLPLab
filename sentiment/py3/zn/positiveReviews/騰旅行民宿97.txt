The host was very nice by helping us to plan and liaise our 2-day trip in Taitung. The trip turned out to be my favorite trip in our 17-day Taiwan journey. Soar was also the first B&B providing VR for free, which gave us great times. It was great to chitchat with the host which I discovered he has been working hard in giving us a nice B&B (like repainting the walls every two weeks) and he has been supportive to Taiwanese people and local brands. The breakfast was great too! Surely go back to Soar if I visit Taitung again! P.s. the host can speak in English so no worries :)
