  
I was booked this hotel on 11th Oct. They charged the room rate through my provided visa card information. When I arrived 11th Nov for rooms check in, they deducted my visa account again without any advice or inform to me. 
I did not know anything about such twice (double) charge until I receive the bank statement. However, I had back home already. 
Up till this moment, still in clarifying and I do not have money back.
Strongly alert anybody who thinking about stay in this hotel. 
本人在10月11日預訂，他們即時在我提供的信用卡戶口中扣除款項，當我在11月11日入住時，他們在沒有給我知道的情況下，再度在我的信用卡中扣除房間費用，可惜我是在回家後，收到銀行月結單才發現。
直到目前，還在跟進，已經多扣的錢沒有退還。
強烈提醒想入住此店的人士。
