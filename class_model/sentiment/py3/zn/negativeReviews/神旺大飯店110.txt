  
1. 房內沒有『電話分機號碼表』，不知如何打給house keeping, 或是其他的服務。
1. There is no inner phone number list in the room. No way to call "house keeping, or the other services.
2. 空調開關及調溫控制權都不能用，只有“中央控制”，全飯店統一。冬天，卻只有”冷氣“！好像是專為北方國家人士準備的空調。沒有各房間自行調溫的方式，很專制！
2. Aircon control unit can only "on & off". Mostly, you may turn it to "fan".  That unit has no temperature select function. Only the temperature hotel set. You have no choice for it. All room temperature is the same as hotel set.  
3. 房內的床太軟，對健康（脊椎）很有壞的影響。
3. Bed is too soft for sleeping. Soft bed make you spinel sick. Check this with your doctors. 
4.  令我們台灣人生氣。We were angry with it.
5. 以後不會再來。
5. Never come back again.
