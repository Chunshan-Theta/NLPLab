  
The hotel has ridiculous policy if u payed by cash,which make us feel annoyed the first night when we checked in they asked us to pay the deposit 9000 but one night hotel is only 7300 after tax , after one night stay my bf decided to stay longer, they asked us to payed another 9000dollars before our second day , we thought we could pay it after check out but we can't and again they charged more for the second night like they did when we checked in .Which leaves me very bad impression about their service ,We both think we would never go again ever
