  
Bathtub was not clean with pieces of hair and sticky stuff stuck on the sides and bottom of the tub. I washed my hair the second morning only to find a ball of my hair still in the filter later that evening. The bedsheets smelled like it was soaked in some herbal drink. It looks like they used all of their money upgrading the lobby but the decor is very old inside the room. The carpet looks like it wasn't changed for years. The fridge was still unplugged when checked into the room. I had to fish for the plug at the back of the fridge and turn the temperature dial inside the fridge to get it working.
