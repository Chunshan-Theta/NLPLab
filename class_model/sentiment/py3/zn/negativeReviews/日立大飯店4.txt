  
choose this hotel only because the comments on booking say that the stuff was kind and can help you with your journey planning. i ve never been to Penghu before and was never a leader for a tour. So i need help badly. its too disappointing that the stuff was so cold. the coldest i have ever met in TW. i had to walk for 20mins to the South Tourist Center for help. and the clerk there said she had met other tourists from abroad mistreat by the stuff in this hotel. Suddenly i understand that the good comments on booking was true, but only for TW people, not for people from mainland China. I will never come back here. 评论里说的好服务都是针对台湾人以及其他地区的人，对大陆人态度非常差。整个旅途的好心情都被这间饭店毁掉了。
