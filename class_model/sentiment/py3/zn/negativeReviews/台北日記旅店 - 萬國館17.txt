The cleaning staff was nice but it seems that the night shift clerk didn't have good abilities to deal with trouble(there was no apologies from the night shift clerk). They transferred us to another branch of this hotel. Somehow, they still asked us to check out at the other branch at 12:00. And when I called back to WanGuo branch. They informed us if we reached there at at about 12:00, we still have to wait for the room. It was not a good experience.1.十三樓隔音很差.2.我們在颱風天入住，入住兩晚，房間在午夜時漏水，店家幫我們換到另一間分店，但是大夜的櫃台卻沒有一聲道歉。隔天在另一間分店，也要我們12點整就離開，打回來萬國館問他們說房間可能要等待房間清理完，感覺不是很好的經驗。(雖然後來12點到萬國館時已經清好了)
