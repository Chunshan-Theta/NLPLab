卻在一個小時之後才告知因為他們在其他網站被預定
導致我們的預定被強制取消
最後還要靠Booking.com幫忙才有地方住...
服務人員態度差
從頭到尾只會說「不好意思沒房間無法服務你喔」

After we booked and confirmation letter was received, 1 hour later, told us that there's no available room for us due to sold out via another website...
But thanks for Booking.com, we finally had room to stay.
Bad service, only repeated and repeated one sentence "sorry, we have no room."
