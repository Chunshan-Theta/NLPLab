  
The front desk staff is very unprofessional.
(1)They do not know how the travel agent functions also it’s so stupid that receptionist does not know how much will be the upgrade fee charge.I been waiting for the check in for over 15 minutes.It’s wasting my time.
(2)if it’s weekned it’s not an excuse that front desk does not receive my reservation.I made the reservation on Friday night however I arrived at 11p.m.on Saturday,the staff told me and my boyfriend that they have not make the reservation yet cause the position did not work on weekend.Even you got 700 rooms,it’s not an excuse to let a guest wasting time for you to make reservation for them especially the guest does not make reservation on their arrival day!
