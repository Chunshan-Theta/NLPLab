Watch the bed board at the end of bed. My husband and i hit the board 6 times a night, it hurts very much！
Additionally, the washing machine operating instructions just said that you have to put "coin" or "token" in the machine,but  did not directly said you have to put  "60 yuan" coins to make it  operate. It waste a lot of my time wondering why the machine did not working cause i thought it would be free or just need one coin.
