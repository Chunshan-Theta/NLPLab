2. 熱水壺旁有 應該是各國通用的插座但已經無法使用 ie. 連熱水壺的插頭都無法使用, 因此我們得在浴室內燒水. The power outlet next to the kettle was meant to be a universal one but did not fit either Taiwan or Australia chargers, the outlet looked loose and possibly was already damaged by previous guests. We had to use the kettle in our bathroom instead.
3. 浴室沒有乾濕分離，必須在浴缸內洗澡但連個浴簾也沒有裝, 洗完澡後浴室馬桶全都是濕的.
The bathroom was bath/shower combined yet there was no shower curtain to stop the water from going all over the bathroom.
4. 實際打開水龍頭時，浴缸底下馬上漏水. 第一位來看的阿姨表示如果不會影響太大的話其實還是可以用. 有想要大事化小 小事化無的感覺. 我告訴她浴室沒有乾濕分離已經有點怪了 現在漏水那麼嚴重是要我們浴室地板一直都是濕的嗎？畢竟我們是要住三個晚上 而且有三個女生一起住 也訂了比較貴的房 所以希望可以換房間. 阿姨說換房間就會變成小房 但他會打電話問一下. 幾分鐘後另一個先生來看了一下, 又叫了兩個阿姨一起進來把浴缸移動 發覺水管沒接好 把水管卡回去就解決問題了。
What made it worse was when we actually turned on the shower, straight away water was leaking from the bottom of the bathtub onto the tiles. The first staff member came to the scene said that it wouldn't affect us 'too much' as in we would just have a very wet bathroom. I advised her we are staying for 3 nights and really shouldn't have this type of issue when booked an "executive room" and asked if there are other rooms available, to which she replied there won't be other executive rooms unless we want to move to a smaller room. I really felt like the hotel should reimburse us if that was the case, not making it sound like a risk we are taking ourselves to compromise their facility issues.
They ended up getting another 2 staff members and moved the bathtub, found the hose not connected properly and fixed the issue for now.
