  
Too noisy that we could hardly sleep. Waken up by water means pies whenever your neighbors or upstairs take a bath or go to toilet.
Extreme soft bed which you couldn’t sleep o.
Air con was funny that you may waken up by cold or you may sweat even you never adjust the air con settings. 
The most terrible breakfast in Tai Wan you could ever imagine, please go out for breakfasts ...
房間是一般雙人房，洗澡時整個房間水管讓極度嘈吵，一直樓上樓下半夜上廁所/洗澡吵醒。
房間床鋪超軟，軟到讓人睡不著，腰痠背痛。
房間空調忽冷忽熱，會冷醒也會熱醒⋯⋯
早餐糟透了，到台灣那麼多次，飯店早餐這這間最不行，寧願外出找早餐店算了⋯⋯
