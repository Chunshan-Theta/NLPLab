  
入住前女主人很熱情的主動用電話聯絡入住時間, 入住時幫我們免費升等到山景三人間, 還加送我們早餐吃, 早餐也兼顧五顏六色的飲食均衡, 從入住到退房驚喜連連, 覺得女主人很用心地對他的每一位客人; 我還特別注意到女主人是急救人員, 住起來格外安心
We got hostess's call with warm regards before we checked-in, and we got room-promotion to Triple Room with Mountain View while check-in (with no reason), thanks for that. One thing more, she invited us to have free breakfast which is colorful and balanced diet. Hostess treats every guest with all her heart. And you can see there is an AED at the lobby because hostess is first-aid personnel, and that make me feel at ease much more.
另外提一個很特別的經驗, 還有跟民宿老闆娘一起搭上熱汽球, 天氣很好, 很幸運, 老闆娘還幫我們導覽, 讓我們受益良多
An unforgettable exp is that we board hot air balloon together with hostess, we are so lucky to have nice weather on the fly. Hostess became our guide who helps us to understand Taitung much more in the air.
住這裡, 可以感受到鹿野的熱情, 如果你還在找住宿, 維妮民宿一個好選擇
