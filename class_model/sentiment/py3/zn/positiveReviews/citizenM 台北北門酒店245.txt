The room view was just gorgeous.  The hotel situated very near from Taipei train station and Metro Ximen station.  If you go from Ximen metro station, just go straight from exit no.6 and walk 3-4 mins you’ll reach the hotel.  The room is quite spacious, all electric equipment in room could be controlled by the iPad and it was user friendly.  You can save much time during check in and check out.
