  
1.離火車站和許多著名景點都很近 very close to the train station and several tourist spots (all in walking distance) 2. 房間雖不大，但是基本配備都有，且便宜。我們一間雙人房+一間三人房，才$1685 not big rooms but are quiet comfortable and provided with basic necessity. besides, the rooms are quiet cheap. I only spent NTD1685 for a double room and a triple room. 3. 提供免費咖啡且早餐遠比我期待的豐富 free coffee and the breakfast was much better than I had expected
