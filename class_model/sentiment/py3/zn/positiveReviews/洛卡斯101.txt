We got to see the scenic view and were surrounded by Bald Cypress and sounds of nature (birds ). The bed and blanket were warm and really comfortable, which felt so nice in winter. The breakfast was terrific. Overall, the experience was fantastic. We highly recommend this place to everyone! One tip though, there is no public transportation, driving is a must! It is around 30-minute drive away from the Luodong night market and almost one hour away to the first trail in Taipingshan.
非常推薦自駕車，想去太平山的朋友們入住在太同香松羅村洛卡斯。這裡離羅東夜市開車大概三十分鐘車程。員工們是泰雅族的原住民，非常友善也很熱情。我們住的小木屋在山丘上，可以眺望遠方的山，房外還有落羽松，是個世外桃源。。房間很大，也乾淨。床跟棉被超級舒服，冬天去真的是想一整天賴在床上。雖然這裡居然太平山還有一段距離，但是房價便宜很多，早餐也很好吃。大推！
