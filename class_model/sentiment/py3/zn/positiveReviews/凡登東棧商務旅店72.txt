  
I stayed here for an unusually early meeting around this area. This hotel is located in a commercial building in the heart of one of Taipei's busiest shopping area. Fairly speaking, this hotel is neat, convenient-located, and quite well maintained. No sign of "suspicious business." Generous "free" breakfast provided in the same room where foreign travelers could make use of the computer. Capable and professional staff. 
精簡但仔細準備的（免費）早餐，房內設備佳、乾淨，室內設計相當聰明，房間空間不大卻感覺一點也不侷促。一般商務飯店的標配都有，感覺不囉嗦、不小氣。Frontdesk人員專業，態度明快。
