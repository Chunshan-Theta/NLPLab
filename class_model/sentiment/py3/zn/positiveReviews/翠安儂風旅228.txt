房間乾淨，佈置簡單但典雅。
有停車場非常好。
下午茶超級美味。一秒置身法國。
服務人員態度極佳。
The breakfast is excellent. They offer customers macaroons at check-in time and they serve handmade bread and cake for breakfast.
The staff is very friendly.
The dessert is divine. Try the afternoon tea here. This might be the reason for us to come back again.
The room is very comfortable. The shower products are of great quality. Free parking is provided.
It is a wonderful hotel at reasonable price that visitors to Taitung should not miss.
