  
The breakfast was excellent, my kids loved the food very much, they also provided afternoon snacks like waffle or instant noodles. The room arrangement was great, it had hot/cold filtered water tank inside the room so it was very convenient. The staffs are very nice and polite, it made me feel like home. I highly recommend this lodging place.
