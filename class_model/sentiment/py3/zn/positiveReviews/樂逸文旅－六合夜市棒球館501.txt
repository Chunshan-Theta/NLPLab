  
地點近車站和捷運,附近有夜市,房間安靜又乾淨,家具地板乾淨實用,員工有禮友善,早餐buffet更是好吃又多樣...物超所值,下次要再來高雄這是首選.
The room is clean, neat and quiet; the staff are very polite; the location:  just a few minutes' walk to the station; the breakfast buffet is excellent and of many varieties . . . all these come at a very good price.   (Peter H from NZ)
