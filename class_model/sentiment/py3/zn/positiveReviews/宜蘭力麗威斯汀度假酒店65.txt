自助餐式的早餐與晚餐都非常的可口，雖然種類不多，但是可以感覺得到主廚的用心，豬肉做得非常好！
員工有禮貌且細心，可口的免費宵夜算是很好的驚喜。
Comparing to ‘traditional’ 5 stars hotel in this area, Westin has larger and newer room and facilities. Hotspring pool is nice and clean too. In the luxury room I stayed, there was light wooden smell, bed is super comfort, very nice experience.
Buffet style breakfast and dinner were all good, even there was not so much variance but you can feel that the chef is putting effort on it.
Staff are very polite and careful. The free late night snack was a pleasant surprise!
