  
Room is quite clean, bed is not too soft and quite comfortable. Hotel is very close to MRT stations. There are also some restaurants or bars nearby. Staff are very polite especially the night shift staff, they greeted us and said hello when we came back to the hotel. Had a good stay in the hotel!! 房間很乾淨 床不會說太軟 睡起來很舒服 飯店離捷運站也很近 所以很方便～附近也有餐廳或酒吧等等 員工蠻親切的 晚上回到飯店的時候 親切的櫃檯員工都會跟我們微笑及打招呼 沒記錯的話是2位夜班的男生～
