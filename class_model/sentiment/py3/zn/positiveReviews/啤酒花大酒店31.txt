Spacious room, comfortable bed, clean bathroom, snack bar all in a pack in this beer-themed boutique hotel. First you get greeted with free draft beer-tasting from super friendly staff then you'll find clever design details everywhere. I would say everything is perfect here and would recommend it to any traveler in Tainan!
